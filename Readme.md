# Applications of Mathematics in Computer Science (MACS) Assignments
The course surveys applications of mathematics in various areas of computer science.   
During each lecture, we raise a problem in computer science, review a mathematical concept relevant for a solution of the problem, and finally see how mathematics is used to solve the problem in practice.   
There are five homework assignments. In homework assignments, we apply mathematical concepts reviewed in class to computer science tasks.

# Required Tools
The assignments were done in Google Colab and implemented in Python.  
* Google Colab: Google online development environment, based on Jupyter Notebooks. No installation required. available at https://colab.research.google.com/
* Introduction to Python: interactive Python tutorial, in Google Colab. available at https://colab.research.google.com/github/cs231n/cs231n.github.io/blob/master/python-colab.ipynb


# The assignments
## Assignment 0 - Intro + Logarithm & Exponent
* Introduction of course's resources and organization: website, Zoom, Google Colab, Python.  
* Logarithm and exponent as mathematical functions, and their role in performing stable floating-point computations in computer science.

## Assignment 1 - Taylor series, optimal polynomials, and Remez algorithm for approximate function computation
Computations involve obtaining values of library functions, such as exp, log, sin, cos, erf, etc. These functions are not 'built-in' into the computer and must be approximated using primitive operations (+, -, *, /).  
We will discuss options for polynomial approximations of functions using different approaches and see how functions are computed in the standard library of a computer language.

## Assignment 2 - Modular arithmetics, hashing, integrity checking, cryptography
Modular arithmetics is a seemingly basic idea of returning both quotient and remainder as the results of integer division. Quite surprisingly, modular arithmetic has important applications in computer science.  
We will look at two applications: hashing and integrity checking.

## Assignment 3 - Complex numbers, Fourier transform, signal processing
Complex numbers are an extension of real numbers, and take the form a + ib where i, the imaginary number, satisfies i2 = -1.  
Complex numbers have many exciting purely mathematical features. However, they also have wide practical uses in computer science, such as signal processing and noise reduction. We will discuss some of the uses.

## Applications 4 - Eigenvalues and eigenvectors, Google PageRank algorithm
Linear algebra deals with linear equations and with related mathematical problems. Linear algebra operates on matrices and vectors, representing coefficients and unknowns in linear expressions.  
Square matrices have many interesting features, one of them is the existence of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. Despite pure mathematical uses, eigenvalues find many applications in computer science.  
We will explore one of them, Google PageRank, the original algorithm behind Google's revolutionary search engine.  

## Assignment 5 - Differentiation, optimization, algorithmic differentiation
Calculus is in the core of many scientific methods in natural sciences. Differential calculus is concerned with finding and computing derivatives of functions. Derivatives are important for efficient optimization algorithms.  
We will learn about algorithmic differentiation, a universal method for computing derivatives of program code, and see examples of its use in modern computation.
